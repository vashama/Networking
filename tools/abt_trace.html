                                TRACEROUTE:
                                <br> The Traceroute utility is a system administrator's tool that shows you the route over the
                                network between two systems, listing all the intermediate routers a connection must pass
                                through to get to its destination. It can be used by network administrators to detect bogus
                                routes or potential redirects of traffic. Attackers can use traceroute to enumerate a path
                                and for firewall discovery. It can help to determine why connections to a given server might
                                be poor, and can often help you figure out where exactly the problem is. It also shows how
                                systems are connected to each other, letting you see how your ISP connects to the Internet
                                as well as how the target system is connected. traceroute attempts to trace the route an
                                IP packet would follow to some internet host by launching probe packets with a small ttl
                                (time to live) then listening for an ICMP "time exceeded" reply from a gateway. It start
                                its probes with a ttl of one and increases this by one until it gets an ICMP "port unreachable"
                                (or TCP reset), which means we got to the "host", or hit a max (which defaults to 30 hops).
                                Three probes (by default) are sent at each ttl setting and a line is printed showing the
                                ttl, address of the gateway and round trip time of each probe. The address can be followed
                                by additional information when requested. If the probe answers come from different gateways,
                                the address of each responding system will be printed. If there is no response within a 5.0
                                seconds (default), an "*" (asterisk) is printed for that probe. As an example, let's say
                                there are normally seven hops from your office in Bangalore to the Delhi office; however,
                                one day, users start complaining of extremely slow traffic. So, when you perform a traceroute,
                                you determine that the hop count is now 14 and your packets are going to New York via China,
                                which may indicate some type of issue. Your packets are taking a different route than usual;
                                this may be a legitimate problem, or an attacker may have manipulated the Border Gateway
                                Protocol routing standard and is potentially redirecting your traffic. Let's look at an example
                                of a simple Windows traceroute, starting with the third hop that is targeting www.example.com.
                                <br>
                                <br> Different types of Traceroute program
                                <br>
                                <br> There are different types of traceroute programs. Each of them works slightly differently.
                                But the overall concept behind each of them is the same. All of them use the TTL value. Why
                                different implementations? That because you can use the one which is applicable to your environment.
                                If suppose a firewall block the UDP traffic then you can use another traceroute for this
                                purpose. The different types are mentioned below.
                                <br> UDP Traceroute
                                <br> ICMP traceroute
                                <br> TCP Traceroute
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br> If you are having trouble connecting to a website, traceroute can tell you where the problem
                                is. It can also help visualize the path traffic takes between your computer and a web server.
                                <br> How to Use Traceroute Traceroute is run from a command prompt or terminal window.
                                <br> To run a traceroute, run the traceroute command followed by the address of a website.
                                <br> For example, if you wanted to run a traceroute on GOOGLE, you'd run the command:
                                <br>
                                <br> $ traceroute www.google.com
                                <br> traceroute to google.com (216.58.220.46), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

                                <br> Understanding the Output
                                <br> The basic idea is self-explanatory.
                                <br> The first line represents your home router (assuming you are behind a router), the next
                                lines represent your ISP, and each line further down represents a router that's further away.
                                <br>
                                <br> The format of each line is as follows:
                                <br> Hop Domain Name [IP Address] RTT1 RTT2 RTT3
                                <br> Hop:

                                <br> Whenever a packet is passed between a router, this is referred to as a "hop"
                                <br> For example, in the output above, we can see that it takes 7 hops to reach Google's servers
                                from my current location.
                                <br>
                                <br> RTT1, RTT2, RTT3:
                                <br> This is the round-trip time that it takes for a packet to get to a hop and back to your
                                computer (in milliseconds). This is often referred to as latency, and is the same number
                                you see when using ping. Traceroute sends three packets to each hop and displays each time,
                                so you have some idea of how consistent (or inconsistent) the latency is. If you see a *
                                in some columns, you didn't receive a response - which could indicate packet loss.
                                <br>
                                <br> Domain Name [IP Address]:
                                <br> The domain name, if available, can often help you see the location of a router. If this
                                isn't available, only the IP address of the router is displayed.
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                <br> --help Display a help message, and exit.
                                <br>
                                <br> -4, -6 Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 tracerouting. By default, the program will try to resolve
                                the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically. If resolving a host name
                                returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, traceroute will use IPv4.
                                <br>
                                <br> -I Use ICMP ECHO for probes.
                                <br>
                                <br> -T Use TCP SYN for probes.
                                <br>
                                <br> -d Enable socket level debugging (if the kernel supports it).
                                <br>
                                <br> -F Do not fragment probe packets.
                                <br> For IPv4 it also sets DF bit, which tells intermediate routers not to fragment remotely
                                as well. Varying the size of the probing packet by the packet_len command-line parameter,
                                you can manually obtain information about the MTU of individual network hops.
                                <br> The --mtuoption (see below) tries to do this automatically. Note, that non-fragmented features
                                (like -F or --mtu) work properly since the Linux kernel 2.6.22 only. Before that version,
                                IPv6 was always fragmented, IPv4 could use the once the discovered final mtu only (from the
                                route cache), which can be less than the actual mtu of a device.
                                <br>
                                <br> -f first_ttl
                                <br> Specifies with what TTL to start. Defaults to 1.
                                <br>
                                <br> -g gateway
                                <br> Tells traceroute to add an IP source routing option to the outgoing packet that tells the
                                network to route the packet through the specified gateway (most routers have disabled source
                                routing for security reasons). In general, specifying multiple gateways is allowed (as a
                                comma-separated list). For IPv6, the form of num,addr,addr... is allowed, wherenum is a route
                                header type (default is type 2). (Note: the type 0 route header is now deprecated, according
                                to rfc5095).
                                <br>
                                <br> -i interface
                                <br> Specifies the interface through which traceroute should send packets. By default, the interface
                                is selected according to the routing table.
                                <br>
                                <br> -m max_ttl
                                <br> Specifies the maximum number of hops (max time-to-live value) traceroute will probe. The
                                default is 30.
                                <br>
                                <br> -N squeries
                                <br> Specifies the number of probe packets sent out simultaneously. Sending several probes concurrently
                                can speed up traceroute considerably. The default value is 16. Note that some routers and
                                hosts can use ICMP rate throttling. In such a situation specifying too large number can lead
                                to loss of some responses.
                                <br>
                                <br> -n Do not try to map IP addresses to host names when displaying them.
                                <br>
                                <br> -p port
                                <br> For UDP tracing, specifies the destination port base traceroute will use (the destination
                                port number will be incremented by each probe). For ICMP tracing, specifies the initial ICMP
                                sequence value (incremented by each probe too). For TCP and others specifies just the (constant)
                                destination port to connect. When using the tcptraceroute wrapper, -pspecifies the source
                                port.

                                <br> -t tos
                                <br> For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS) and Precedence value. Useful values are 16 (low
                                delay) and 8 (high throughput). Note that in order to use some TOS precedence values, you
                                have to be superuser. For IPv6, set the Traffic Control value.
                                <br>
                                <br> -l flow_label
                                <br> Use specified flow_label for IPv6 packets.
                                <br>
                                <br> -w waittime
                                <br> Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe (default is 5.0).
                                <br>
                                <br> -q nqueries
                                <br> Sets the number of probe packets per hop. The default is 3.
                                <br>
                                <br> -r
                                <br> Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network. If
                                the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned. This option can be
                                used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it.
                                <br>
                                <br> -s source_addr
                                <br> Chooses an alternative source address. Note that you must select the address of one of the
                                interfaces. By default, the address of the outgoing interface is used.
                                <br>
                                <br> -z sendwait
                                <br> Minimal time interval between probes (default 0). If the value is more than 10, then it
                                specifies a number in milliseconds, else it is a number of seconds (floating point values
                                allowed too). Useful when some routers use rate-limit for ICMP messages.
                                <br>
                                <br> -e Show ICMP extensions
                                <br> The general form is CLASS/TYPE: followed by a hexadecimaldump. The MPLS (Multiprotocol Label
                                Switching) data is shown parsed, in a form:MPLS:L=label,E=exp_use,S=stack_bottom,T=TTL (with
                                any further objects separated by a slash ("/")).
                                <br>
                                <br> -A Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and print results directly after the corresponding
                                addresses.
                                <br>
                                <br> -V Print version information, and exit.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br> The following options are intended for an advanced usage (another trace methods etc.):
                                <br>
                                <br> --sport=port
                                <br> Chooses the source port to use. Implies -N 1. Normally source ports (if applicable) are
                                chosen by the0 system.
                                <br>
                                <br> --fwmark=mark

                                <br> Set the firewall mark for outgoing packets (since Linux kernel 2.6.25).
                                <br>
                                <br> -M method
                                <br> Use specified method for traceroute operations. Default traditional udp method is called
                                default, and icmp (-I) and tcp (-T) have the names icmp and tcp, respectively. Method-specific
                                options can be passed by -O. Most methods have their simple shortcuts (-I means -M icmp,
                                etc).
                                <br>
                                <br> -O option
                                <br> Specifies some method-specific option. Several options are separated by comma (or use several
                                -O specifications on the command-line). Each method may have its own specific options, or
                                many not have them at all. To print information about available options, use -O help.
                                <br>
                                <br> -U

                                <br> Use UDP to particular destination port for tracerouting (instead of increasing the port
                                per each probe). Default port is 53 (dns).
                                <br>
                                <br> -UL Use UDPLITE for tracerouting (default port is 53).
                                <br>
                                <br> -D Use DCCP Requests for probes.
                                <br>
                                <br> -P protocol
                                <br> Use raw packet of specified protocol for tracerouting. Default protocol is 253, as per rfc3692.
                                <br>
                                <br> --mtu Discover MTU along the path being traced
                                <br> Implies -F -N 1. New mtu is printed once in a form of F=NUM at the first probe of a hop
                                which requires such mtu to be reached. (Actually, the correspond "frag needed" icmp message
                                normally is sent by the previous hop).
                                <br> Note, that some routers might cache once the seen information on a fragmentation. Thus you
                                can receive the final mtu from a closer hop. Try to specify an unusual tos by -t, this can
                                help for one attempt (then it can be cached there as well). See -Foption for more info.
                                <br>
                                <br> --back

                                <br> Print the number of backward hops when it seems different with the forward direction. This
                                number is guessed in assumption that remote hops send reply packets with initial ttl set
                                to either 64, 128 or 255 (which is a common practice). It is printed as a negative value
                                in a form of '-NUM' .
                                <br>
                                <br> Traceroute output first displays the IP address of the destination and the maximum number
                                of hops it will traverse before it will quit the trace. Next, it displays the name, IP address
                                and response time taken at each hop.
                                <br>
                                <br> 1 is the internet gateway of the network the trace is started from
                                <br> 2 is normally the Internet service provider's (ISP) gateway
                                <br> 3 is usually the backbone ISP's hop name and IP address
                                <br> This trace continues to the destination domain, listing all the hops along the way.
