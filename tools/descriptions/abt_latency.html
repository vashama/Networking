                                <br> Network latency is the term used to indicate any kind of delay that happens in data communication
                                over a network. Network connections in which small delays occur are called low-latency networks
                                whereas network connections which suffers from long delays are called high-latency networks.
                                <br> Network latency can kill application performance. High latency creates bottlenecks in any
                                network communication. It prevents the data from taking full advantage of the network pipe
                                and effectively decreases the communication bandwidth. The impact of latency on network bandwidth
                                can be temporary or persistent based on the source of the delays.
                                <br> httping lets you measure the latency and throughput of a web server. Httping is like 'ping'
                                but for http-requests. Giving a url, and it'll show you how long it takes to connect, send
                                a request and retrieve the reply (only the headers). So it measures the latency of the web
                                server + network.
                                <br>
                                <br>Possible contributors to network latency include:
                                <br> Problems with the transmission medium itself.
                                <br> Errors with the router or switches as each gateway takes time to examine and change the
                                packet header.
                                <br> Anti-virus and similar security processes by often requiring complete message reassembly
                                and tear down before sending on.
                                <br> The propagation time or the time it takes for a packet to physically travel from its source
                                to a destination.
                                <br> Storage delays when packets are subject to storage or disk access delays at intermediate
                                devices like switches and bridges.
                                <br> Software malfunctions at the user level can cause some delays from a user perspective.
                                <br> With the help of this analysis, network administrators can re-route packets to minimize
                                the network latency.

                                <br>
                                <br>Options
                                <br>
                                <br> -g url
                                <br> This selects the url to probe. E.g.: http://localhost/
                                <br>
                                <br> -h hostname
                                <br> Instead of '-g' one can also set a hostname to probe with -h: -h localhost
                                <br>
                                <br> -p portnumber
                                <br> -p can be used together with -h. -p selects the portnumber to probe.
                                <br>
                                <br> -x [proxyhost:port]
                                <br> Probe using a proxyserver. Note that you're also measuring the latency of the proxyserver!
                                <br>
                                <br> -c count
                                <br> How many probes to send before exiting.
                                <br>
                                <br> -i interval
                                <br> How many seconds to sleep between every probe sent.
                                <br>
                                <br> -t timeout
                                <br> How long to wait for answer from the other side.
                                <br>
                                <br> -S Split measured latency in time to connect and time to exchange a request with the HTTP
                                server.
                                <br>
                                <br> -s When a successful transaction was done, show the HTTP statuscode (200, 404, etc.).
                                <br>
                                <br> -G Do a GET request instead of a HEAD request: this means that also the complete page/file
                                must be transferred. Note that in this case you're no longer measuring the latency!
                                <br>
                                <br> -b Use this switch together with '-G'. When this option is used, the transferspeed (in KB/s)
                                is shown.
                                <br>
                                <br> -B Use this switch together with '-G'. Ask the HTTP server to compress the returned data:
                                this will reduce the influence of the bandwidth of your connection while increasing the influence
                                of the processorpower of the HTTP server.
                                <br>
                                <br> -L x
                                <br> Use this switch together with '-G'. Limit the amount of data transferred to 'x'. Note that
                                this only affects the content of the page/file and not the headerdata.
                                <br>
                                <br> -X Use this switch together with '-G'. For each "ping" show the amount of data transferred
                                (excluding the headers).
                                <br>
                                <br> -l Connect using SSL
                                <br> For this to work you need to give a 'https'-url or a 443 portnumber.
                                <br>
                                <br> -z When connecting using SSL, display the fingerprint of the X509 certificate(s) of the
                                peer.
                                <br>
                                <br> -a Audible ping
                                <br>
                                <br> -f Flood ping
                                <br> Do not sit idle between each ping but ping as fast as the computer and network allow you
                                to.
                                <br>
                                <br> -m Show machine readable output (also check '-o' and '-e')
                                <br>
                                <br> -o x,x,...
                                <br> This selects the HTTP status-codes which are regarded as an OK-state (only with '-m')
                                <br>
                                <br> -e str
                                <br> When the status-code differs from the ones selected with '-o', the given string is displayed
                                <br>
                                <br> -I str
                                <br> UserAgent-string to send to the webserver (instead of 'HTTPing version')
                                <br>
                                <br> -R str
                                <br> Referer-string to send to the webserver
                                <br>
                                <br> -r Only resolve the hostname once This takes the resolving out of the loop so that the latency
                                of the DNS is not measured. Also usefull when you want to measure only 1 webserver while
                                the DNS returns a different ip-address for each resolve ('roundrobin').
