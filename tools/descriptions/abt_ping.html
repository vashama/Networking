                                PING (Packet INternet Groper) tool is the best way to test connectivity between two nodes. Packet loss is a common problem
                                in the IP networks. Ping, although simple, is an excellent tool in order to troubleshoot
                                packet loss issues. The success or failure of this very simple operation can provide some
                                insight into the state of a network or a series of networks.
                                <br> Ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE
                                from a host or gateway. ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (''pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed
                                by a struct timeval and then an arbitrary number of ''pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.
                                In most cases, the ICMP echo-request packets and echo-reply packets, upon which ping's functionality
                                relies, are allowed through routers and firewalls, however with the advent of trojans and
                                distributed denial of service tools which transmit information within ICMP packets, some
                                networks and network administrators block ICMP at their borders. As a result of these nefarious
                                uses of echo-request and echo-reply packets, some cautious network administrators block all
                                non-essential ICMP at their border routers. Thus, we can no longer assume that simply because
                                a host is not answering our ping request, this host is down. There may be a device which
                                has been configured to filter out this traffic.
                                <br> If a host is reachable and answering our echo-requests, then we may also wish to believe
                                that the round-trip times recorded by ping are an accurate representation of network conditions.
                                This can be misleading. Some routers are configured to give ICMP diagnostic messages the
                                lowest priority of any IP packets travelling through them, in which case that router may
                                contribute significantly to the round trip time of any echo-request packet passing through
                                it.
                                <br>

                                <br> OPTIONS:
                                <br>
                                <br> -a Audible ping.
                                <br>
                                <br> -A Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so that effectively not
                                more than one (or more, if preload is set) unanswered probes present in the network. Minimal
                                interval is 200msec for not super-user. On networks with low rtt this mode is essentially
                                equivalent to flood mode.
                                <br>
                                <br> -b Allow pinging a broadcast address.
                                <br>
                                <br> -B Do not allow ping to change source address of probes. The address is bound to one selected
                                when ping starts.
                                <br>
                                <br> -c count
                                <br> Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets. With deadline option, ping waits for count
                                ECHO_REPLY packets, until the timeout expires.
                                <br>
                                <br> -d Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used. Essentially, this socket option is
                                not used by Linux kernel.
                                <br>
                                <br> -F flow label
                                <br> Allocate and set 20 bit flow label on echo request packets. (Only ping6). If value is zero,
                                kernel allocates random flow label.
                                <br>
                                <br> -f Flood ping
                                <br> For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ''.'' is printed, while for every ECHO_REPLY received
                                a backspace is printed. This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.
                                If interval is not given, it sets interval to zero and outputs packets as fast as they come
                                back or one hundred times per second, whichever is more. Only the super-user may use this
                                option with zero interval.
                                <br>
                                <br> -i interval
                                <br> Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one second
                                between each packet normally, or not to wait in flood mode. Only super-user may set interval
                                to values less 0.2 seconds.
                                <br>
                                <br> -I interface address
                                <br> Set source address to specified interface address. Argument may be numeric IP address or
                                name of device. When pinging IPv6 link-local address this option is required.
                                <br>
                                <br> -l preload
                                <br> If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets not waiting for reply. Only the super-user
                                may select preload more than 3.
                                <br>
                                <br> -L Suppress loopback of multicast packets. This flag only applies if the ping destination
                                is a multicast address.
                                <br>
                                <br> -n Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses.
                                <br>
                                <br> -p pattern
                                <br> You may specify up to 16 ''pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you send. This is useful for
                                diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network. For example, -p ff will cause the sent packet
                                to be filled with all ones.
                                <br>
                                <br> -Q tos
                                <br> Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams. tos can be either decimal or hex
                                number. Traditionally (RFC1349), these have been interpreted as: 0 for reserved (currently
                                being redefined as congestion control), 1-4 for Type of Service and 5-7 for Precedence. Possible
                                settings for Type of Service are: minimal cost: 0x02, reliability: 0x04, throughput: 0x08,
                                low delay: 0x10. Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. Possible settings for
                                special Precedence range from priority (0x20) to net control (0xe0). You must be root (CAP_NET_ADMIN
                                capability) to use Critical or higher precedence value. You cannot set bit 0x01 (reserved)
                                unless ECN has been enabled in the kernel. In RFC2474, these fields has been redefined as
                                8-bit Differentiated Services (DS), consisting of: bits 0-1 of separate data (ECN will be
                                used, here), and bits 2-7 of Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP).
                                <br>
                                <br> -q Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when
                                finished.
                                <br>
                                <br> -R Record route. Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays
                                the route buffer on returned packets. Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine
                                such routes. Many hosts ignore or discard this option.
                                <br>
                                <br> -r Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached interface.
                                If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned. This option can
                                be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it provided the
                                option -I is also used.
                                <br>
                                <br> -s packetsize
                                <br> Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into
                                64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.

                                <br> Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not more than one packet.

                                <br> -t ttl Set the IP Time to Live.

                                <br> Set special IP timestamp options. timestamp option may be either tsonly (only timestamps),
                                tsandaddr (timestamps and addresses) or tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]] (timestamp
                                prespecified hops).

                                <br> -M hint
                                <br> Select Path MTU Discovery strategy. hint may be either do (prohibit fragmentation, even
                                local one), want (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large), or dont
                                (do not set DF flag).
                                <br>
                                <br> -U Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour). Normally ping prints network round
                                trip time, which can be different f.e. due to DNS failures.
                                <br>

                                <br> Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been
                                sent or received. In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either
                                for deadline expire or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from
                                network.

                                <br> Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only timeout in absence of any
                                responses, otherwise ping waits for two RTTs.

                                <br> The responses essentially tell you how long it took the specified machine to respond with
                                56 bytes of data. At the end of the run, ping summarizes the number of replies, and performs
                                some calculations on the round-trip times. As with much data collection, you need a large
                                sample set of data to draw conclusions about your network.
                                <br>
                                <br> Typically, when you issue the ping command, one of following things will happen, each of
                                which has its own meaning:
                                <br> The first thing that can happen is that the specified machine will produce four replies.
                                This indicates that the workstation is able to communicate with the specified host at the
                                TCP/IP level. The second thing that can happen is that all four requests time out. If you
                                look at Figure A, you will notice that each response ends in TTL=128. TTL stands for "time
                                to live." What this means is that each of the four queries and responses must be completed
                                within 128 milliseconds. The TTL is also decremented once for each hop on the way back.
                                <br> At any rate, if all four requests have timed out, it means that the TTL expired before the
                                reply was received. This can mean one of three things: Communication problems are preventing
                                packets from flowing between the two machines: This could be caused by a disconnected cable,
                                a bad routing table, or a number of other issues. Communications are occurring, but are too
                                slow for ping to acknowledge: This can be caused by extreme network congestion, or by faulty
                                network hardware or wiring. Communications are functional, but a firewall is blocking ICMP
                                traffic: Ping will not work unless the destination machine's firewall (and any firewalls
                                between the two machines) allow ICMP echoes. A third thing that can happen when you enter
                                the ping command is that some replies are received, while others time out. This can point
                                to bad network cabling, faulty hardware, or extreme network congestion.

                                <br> 2. Using ping to stress a network
                                <br> Occasionally, you'll want to stress the network to test how many packets you can squeeze
                                through a link, and how gracefully performance on that link degrades. Fortunately, ping,
                                when run with the -f switch can perform exactly this kind of test for you.
                                <br> [root@morgan]# ping -c 400 -f -n 192.168.99.254
                                <br> PING 192.168.99.254 (192.168.99.254) from 192.168.98.82 : 56(84) bytes of data.
                                <br> ............
                                <br> --- 192.168.99.254 ping statistics ---
                                <br> 411 packets transmitted, 400 packets received, 2% packet loss
                                <br> round-trip min/avg/max/mdev = 37.840/62.234/97.807/12.946 ms
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br> In this example, we have used the default packet size and sent 411 packets, receiving only
                                400 back from the remote host for a mere 2% packet loss. By increasing the packet size of
                                the packet we are sending across the link we can get a sense for how quickly performance
                                degrades on this link. If we use a much larger packet size (still smaller than Ethernet's
                                1500 byte frame), we see even more packet loss. We can specify a packet size of 512 bytes
                                with the -s option.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br> 3. Recording a network route with ping
                                <br> Ping is even nice enough to report to us that a subsequent journey took the same route as
                                the first packet. If you have a statically routed internal network, any subsequent packets
                                should look exactly like the second packet. If dynamic routing is in use on your internal
                                network, you may find that the routes change occasionally.
                                <br> As always, ping summarizes the output after it has completed its run, but let’s examine
                                the new section. By using the record route option, we are asking all routers along the way
                                to include their IPs in the header. Although some routers may not observe this courtesy,
                                many do. Unfortunately, there is only room to record 8 different hops, so the use of ping
                                -R is mostly useful only in smaller networks. Ping with the record route option (-R) doesn't
                                convey the information in as visually an appealing way, but it can get the job done.

                                <br> 4. Setting ToS for a diagnostic ping
                                <br> Type of Service (ToS) is increasingly in use on backbones across the Internet which has
                                brought with it Service Level Agreements (SLA). If you have an SLA with your provider, you
                                may find the use of ping-Q to set the IP packet ToS flags will help you to determine if your
                                provider is holding up their end of the bargain.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br> 5. Specifying a source address for ping
                                <br> Occasionally, you'll find yourself on a heavily packet filtered host, or a host which employs
                                conditional routing for packets with certain source addresses. Such packet filtering can
                                prevent or conflict with the use of ping. Fortunately, ping allows the user to specify the
                                source address of an outbound packet, thus allowing traversal of packet filters and conditional
                                routing tables. As you can see, ping is a versatile tool in the network administrator's toolkit,
                                and can be used for a wide range of tests beyond the simple reachability test.
