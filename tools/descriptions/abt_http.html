                                The <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is an application protocol for distributed,
                                collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication
                                for the World Wide Web. The standard port for HTTP connections is port 80.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Overview:</b>
                                <br>
                                <br> HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model. A web
                                browser, for example, may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting
                                a web site may be the server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The
                                server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other
                                functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response
                                contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content
                                in its message body.
                                <br>
                                <br> A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user agent include the
                                indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and
                                other software that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.
                                <br>
                                <br> HTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications
                                between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that
                                deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache
                                previously accessed web resources and reuse them when possible to reduce network traffic.
                                HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients
                                without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.
                                <br>
                                <br> HTTP resources are identified and located on the network by uniform resource locators (URLs),
                                using the uniform resource identifier (URI) schemes http and https. URIs and hyperlinks in
                                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents form inter-linked hypertext documents.

                                <br>
                                <br> Short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, HTTPS is a protocol which uses HTTP on a connection
                                encrypted by transport-layer security. HTTPS is used to protect transmitted data from eavesdropping.
                                It is the default protocol for conducting financial transactions on the web, and can protect
                                a website's users from censorship by a government or an ISP. HTTPS uses port 443 to transfer
                                its information.
                                <br>

                                <b>Request Methods</b>
                                <br>
                                <br> HTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as verbs) to indicate the desired action to
                                be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing
                                data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server.
                                Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the
                                server. Given below are the request methods of http.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>GET</b>
                                <br>The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should
                                only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP
                                methods.) The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, "Web application
                                design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.
                                See safe methods below.

                                <br>
                                <b>HEAD</b>
                                <br>The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response
                                body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without
                                having to transport the entire content.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>POST</b>
                                <br>The POST method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new
                                subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example,
                                an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing
                                list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a
                                data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.
                                <br>

                                <b>PUT</b>
                                <br>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the
                                URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to
                                an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>DELETE</b>
                                <br>The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>TRACE</b>
                                <br>The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes
                                or additions have been made by intermediate servers.
                                <br>

                                <b>OPTIONS</b>
                                <br>The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL.
                                This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting instead of a specific
                                resource.

                                <b>CONNECT</b>
                                <br>The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually
                                to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy. See
                                HTTP CONNECT tunneling.

                                <br>The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

                                <br>All general-purpose HTTP servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods
                                and, whenever possible, also the OPTIONS method.

                                <br>
                                <br>When a browser requests a service from a web server, an error might occur. The first line
                                of the HTTP response is called the status line and includes a numeric status code (such as
                                "404") and a textual reason phrase (such as "Not Found"). The way the user agent handles
                                the response primarily depends on the code and secondarily on the other response header fields.
                                Custom status codes can be used since, if the user agent encounters a code it does not recognize,
                                it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response. The
                                standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the reason phrase, though this
                                might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable
                                and reason phrases are human-readable. HTTP status code is primarily divided into five groups
                                for better explanation of request and responses between client and server as named: Informational
