                                The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected
                                to the Internet or a private network.Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized
                                domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying
                                computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide,
                                distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality
                                of the Internet. In other words, it is an Internet service that translates domain names into
                                IP addresses, because domain names are used as they are alphabetic and are easier to remember.
                                The Internet however, is really based on IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name,
                                therefore, a DNS service must translate the name into the corresponding IP address. An often-used
                                analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet
                                by translating human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain
                                name www.example.com might translate to 198.105.232.4.

                                <br>The DNS system is, in fact, its own network. If one DNS server doesn't know how to translate
                                a particular domain name, it asks another one, and so on, until the correct IP address is
                                returned.The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and
                                mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each
                                domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated
                                name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault tolerant
                                service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.

                                <br>The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy[1] and the Internet
                                Protocol (IP) address spaces.[2] The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy
                                and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers
                                and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System.[3] A DNS name server is a
                                server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers
                                to queries against its database.

                                <br>The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for DNS zone authority (SOA),
                                IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse
                                DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general
                                purpose database, DNS can store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups,
                                such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As
                                a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam)
                                by storing a real-time blackhole list. The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured
                                zone file.

                                <br>The Internet Domain Name System is managed by a Name Registration Authority on the Internet,
                                responsible for maintaining top-level domains that are assigned by organization and by country/region.
                                These domain names follow the International Standard 3166. Some of the many existing abbreviations,
                                reserved for use by organizations, as well as two-letter and three-letter abbreviations used
                                for countries/regions. Some DNS Top-level Domain Names (TLDs) are given below:

                                <br>DNS is made up of many different elements which control different aspects of your domain
                                name.
                                <br>
                                <br><b>Nameserver:</b> Nameservers "point" your domain name to the company that controls its
                                DNS settings. Usually, this will be the company where you registered the domain name. However,
                                if your website is hosted by another company, sometimes you'll need to use their nameservers.
                                <br>
                                <br><b>Zone File:</b> Zone Files are simply the files that store all of your domain's DNS settings.
                                Your domain name's Zone File is stored on the company's nameserver.
                                <br>
                                <br><b>A Record:</b> A Records point your domain name to an individual server using an IP address.
                                An example IP address is 123.4.67.5. You can also use A Records to point subdomains (for
                                example subdomain.coolexample.com) to a server's IP address. Every domain name has a primary
                                A Record called "@," which controls what your domain name does when some visits it directly.
                                <br>
                                <br><b>CNAME:</b> CNAMEs point your subdomains to another server using a server name. Unlike
                                A Records, CNAMEs cannot use IP addresses. Most domain names have many CNAMEs.
                                <br>
                                <br><b>MX Records:</b> MX Records point your domain name's email to its email provider.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br><b>Address resolution mechanism</b>
                                <br>
                                <br> In theory a full host name may have several name segments, (e.g ahost.ofasubnet.ofabiggernet.inadomain.example).
                                In practice, full host names will frequently consist of just three segments (ahost.inadomain.example,
                                and most often www.inadomain.example). For querying purposes, software interprets the name
                                segment by segment, from right to left, using an iterative search procedure. At each step
                                along the way, the program queries a corresponding DNS server to provide a pointer to the
                                next server which it should consult.

                                <br>A DNS recursor consults three nameservers to resolve the address www.wikipedia.org.

                                <br>As originally envisaged, the process was as simple as:

                                <br> 1. The local system is pre-configured with the known addresses of the root servers in a
                                file of root hints, which need to be updated periodically by the local administrator from
                                a reliable source to be kept up to date with the changes which occur over time.
                                <br>
                                <br> 2. Query one of the root servers to find the server authoritative for the next level down
                                (so in the case of our simple hostname, a root server would be asked for the address of a
                                server with detailed knowledge of the example top level domain).
                                <br>
                                <br> 3. Querying this second server for the address of a DNS server with detailed knowledge of
                                the second-level domain (inadomain.example in our example).
                                <br>
                                <br> 4. Repeating the previous step to progress down the name, until the final step which would,
                                rather than generating the address of the next DNS server, return the final address sought.
                                <br>The mechanism in this simple form has a difficulty: it places a huge operating burden on
                                the root servers, with every search for an address starting by querying one of them. Being
                                as critical as they are to the overall function of the system, such heavy use would create
                                an insurmountable bottleneck for trillions of queries placed every day. In practice caching
                                is used to overcome this problem, and in actual fact root nameservers deal with very little
                                of the total traffic.
                                <br>

                                <br><b>Domain Name Registration Process</b>
                                <br>
                                <br>In order to reserve a domain, a registrant must register it with one of almost a thousand
                                ICANN-accredited registrars. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
                                is the international non-profit corporation that oversees the assignment of both IP addresses
                                and domain names. It has responsibility for managing root server and TLD name system management
                                and has contractual agreements with both registries and registrars.

                                <br><b>A registrant</b> is the person or organization who has registered the domain name. In
                                order to do so, the registrant will usually apply online to a domain registrar or one of
                                their resellers. The registrant is bound by the terms and conditions of the registrar with
                                which it registers its domain name, for instance adhering to a certain code of conduct or
                                indemnifying the registrar and registry against any legal or civil action taken as a result
                                of use of the domain name. Registrants have certain responsibilities that are incorporated
                                into these terms and conditions like payment of registration fees and submission and timely
                                update of accurate data.

                                <br>In addition to registering the name, registrants also need to have their domains listed on
                                name servers in order to have that domain reachable on the Internet. A registrant is responsible
                                for procuring or hosting his or her own name server if the registrar does not offer this
                                service or he or she has opted out of the registrars service.

                                <br><b>Registrars</b> are organizations accredited by ICANN and certified by the registry operators
                                to sell domains. They are bound by the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) with ICANN
                                - and by their agreements with the registry operators. The RAA sets out responsibilities
                                for the registrar including maintenance of WHOIS data, submission of data to domain registries,
                                facilitating public WHOIS queries, ensuring registrants details are escrowed, and complying
                                with RAA conditions relating to the conclusion of the registration period.

                                <br>Some registrants may opt to register through a <b>reseller</b>. These are affiliated or under
                                contract with registrars, and usually offer other services such as web hosting, email mailboxes
                                etc. Resellers are bound by their agreements with the registrar(s) whose services they sell;
                                they are not accredited by ICANN. However, the registrar for whom they are re-selling will
                                still be the sponsor for the domain name registration and accountable for the domains sold
                                by the reseller.

                                <br>While registrars are contracted to conduct the day-to-day business of selling domain name
                                registrations, <b>registry operators</b> are responsible for maintaining the registry for
                                each TLD. The responsibilities of the registry operator include accepting registration requests
                                (whether from registrars or directly from registrants), maintaining a database of the necessary
