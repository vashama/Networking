                                Websites and web applications today are increasingly more complex and will break. An average website crashes at least every
                                month. Sometimes it is with the code, the server or the network. When your website isn t
                                available it can mean lower sales, brand damage, and even lower search engine rankings. Manually
                                checking if your website is online is time consuming, inconvenient and unnecessary.
                                <br>
                                <br> That is why our project aims at providing a monitoring service and tools that helps you
                                do that work. It monitors your websites every 5 minutes and alerts you if your sites are
                                down. Rest assured that you will be the first to know if your website is down.

                                <b>What is network monitoring?<b/>
<br>
    Network monitoring is the use of a system that constantly monitors a computer network for slow or failing components and that notifies the network administrator (via email, SMS or other alarms) in case of outages. It is part of network management.
 A network monitoring system monitors the network for problems caused by overloaded and/or crashed servers, network connections or other devices. Commonly measured metrics are response time, availability and uptime.
<br>
The server monitoring may be internal, i.e. web server software checks its status and notifies the owner if some services go down, and external, i.e. some web server monitoring companies check the services status with a certain frequency.
<br>
External monitoring is more reliable, as it keeps on working when the server completely goes down and also third-party application performance monitoring tools provide additional web server monitoring, alerting and reporting capabilities.
<br>
Network monitoring services usually have a number of servers around the globe - for example in America, Europe, Asia, Australia and other locations. By having multiple servers in different geographic locations, a monitoring service can determine if a Web server is available across different networks worldwide. The more the locations used, the more complete is the picture on network availability.
<br><br>
<b>Our performance monitoring<b/>
Most of the  network monitoring software  sites are offering  options-limited free network tools, and time-limited free performance monitoring options.
Best of the features are included in the premium versions which costs high amount of money for usage, leading to extra expenses for the organization.
<br>
So, we want to offer a website which is completely free and includes most of the available network statistics tools and performance monitoring that caters to the requirements of registered users for an organization.It would typically cost them the price of a Raspberry Pi and the very low power that is consumed by it.
